# FurnitAR
This is our hackathon project from HACKWIT 2017. Our project seeks to provide a better customer experience.Through our platform, user can view the product inside their Tablets or phones through the Camera. The viewer can also rotate the furnitures into their desired angle. Users can also browse through the catalogue of furnitures and decide the best fit for their home. 

The project was implemented with KudanAR (https://www.kudan.eu/)
and Unity3D.
